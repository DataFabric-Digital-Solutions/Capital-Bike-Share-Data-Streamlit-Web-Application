# Capital-Bike-Share-Data-Streamlit-Web-Application
It is a web app tutorial project made with streamlit, a ML web app tool. It has some super cool features that can eliminate the need of any web framework. So, a data scientist can focus entirely on the analytics part rather than worrying about managing frontend and backend with any sort of framework. Do check out this project!
